# üåü What is TSCord

#### **TSCord** is a fully-featured **Discord bots** *template* written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), intended to provide a framework that's easy to use, extend and modify.

It uses [`discord.ts`](https://github.com/oceanroleplay/discord.ts) and [`discord.js v14`](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) under the hood to simplify the development of discord bots.

This template was created to give developers a starting point for new Discord bots, so that much of the initial setup can be avoided and developers can instead focus on meaningful bot features. Developers can simply copy this repo, follow the [setup instructions](https://barthofu.github.io/tscord-template-docs), and have a working bot with many boilerplate features already included!

## üìú Features

Talking about features, here are some of the core features of the template:

- Advanced **handlers** for:
    - Interactions (slash, context menu, button, modal, select menu, etc)
    - Simple message commands
    - Discord events listeners
- **Guards** functions, acting like middlewares on handlers with some built-ins:
    - Rate limiter
    - Maintenance mode
    - Disabling command
    - Guild only command (no DMs)
    - NSFW only command
    - Message's content match using regex
- Internal **API** to interact with the bot from external services, with built-in useful endpoints
- Multiple **databases** support out-of-the-box using [Mikro-ORM](https://mikro-orm.io/)
- **Migrations** system to keep a safe database
- **Custom events** handlers
- Advanced **error handler**
- Fully-typed **localization** (i18n)
- Local **store** to manage global state through the app
- Advanced **logger** with log files and discord channels support
- **Scheduler** for cron jobs
- Built-in rich **statistics** system
- Automatic **static assets upload** to [imgur](https://imgur.com/)
- **WebSocket** server with decorators driven events system

This template is also developper friendly and follow strict design patterns to ease its maintenance:
- Written in **Typescript**
- Built around the **Dependency Injection** and **Singleton** patterns
- Use of battle-tested **libraries** under the hood (*discord.ts* and *discord.js*)
- Built-in **debugging** setup for VSCode
- Support for running with the **[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/)** process manger
- Support for running with **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**
- CI/CD integration with **Github Actions**

*and many more!*
